# Data Warehousing with Airflow and AWS
This project uses Apache Airflow to orchestrate the music streaming company's app data via Amazon Redshift.

## Background
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow. We have to create high grade data pipeline that is dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills.
